* JavaScript
Started with the idea to work on interactive graphics.  Then, I spoke
with you about the project, and you gave me several possibilities for
working with interactive graphics.  One of which was to use SVG
annotate and to use jave script to make the interactive part.  I used
this as an opportunity to start learning javascript, and I made a
simple website for my sister's birthday.

* D3
Though looking and working with JavaScript, I decided to try using D3.
I worked through some tutorials to create svg objects an different 
groups.  Then, I learned that D3 will automatically generate the plots
from the given data.  I wasn't going to need R to create plots using
D3.  I spoke to you again about this, and you mentioned how with D3
the data cannot be changed.
