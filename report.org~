* JavaScript
Started with the idea to work on interactive graphics.  Then, I spoke
with you about the project, and you gave me several possibilities for
working with interactive graphics.  One of which was to use SVG
annotate and to use jave script to make the interactive part.  I used
this as an opportunity to start learning javascript, and I made a
simple website for my sister's birthday.
